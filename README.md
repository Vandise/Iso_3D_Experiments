# Iso-3D Experiments

This is a collection of my iso-3D experiments and artwork that I created between 2005 and 2007.  It is published here in the hope that it will be useful.

## Required software

While the browsergame demo can be viewed using any web browser, recreation of the graphics files and executables requires certain pieces of legacy software:

- Caligary TrueSpace, preferably version 2.0 or 3.2
- Borland Turbo Pascal, preferably version 7.0
- SVGA BGI drivers by Jordan Horgraphix Software (shareware)

## Graphics file conversion

Do not use the GIF versions, as they have reduced color precision.  Use the BMP versions, instead.

You can easily convert them to PNG with transparency using ImageMagick:

    convert MyGameTP/berg_1.bmp -transparent magenta berg_1.png
